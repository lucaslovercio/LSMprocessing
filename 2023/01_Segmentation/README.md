## Segmentation

The article "Quantitative integration of cell proliferation..." was produced using the MATLAB code, except for the tissue segmentation performed in Python. We are providing the Python code as it has been produced during our ongoing code migration.

Tissue segmentation of 256x256 patch size (from 4096x4096 patch size). For nuclei (DAPI/Nuclear Green) and proliferating cells (pHH3) segmentation, refer to 2022_IEEE_Access folder.

MATLAB code written by Lucas Lo Vercio. Python code written by Anandita Mahika and Lucas Lo Vercio.
