## Introduction

It is provided:
* Dataset of annotated DAPI-stained and PHH3-stained slices.
* Scripts and pretrained U-net for segmentating mesenchyme and neural ectodem in Lightsheet Microscopy (LSM)  DAPI-stained images.
* Pretrained network for segmenting cells in DAPI-stained slices using the Fiji-plugin by Falk et al. (2019).
* Pretrained network for segmenting proliferative cells in PHH3-stained slices using the Fiji-plugin by Falk et al. (2019).

## Datasets

The datasets and trained U-nets (H5 files) can be found in:
